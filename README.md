## Cheers and Welcome!

With the rambunctious rhythms of freshly interpreted folk traditionals, as well as a handful of his own songs, Brian Kenneth will get your hands a-clapping and your toes a-tapping!

Listen in, and let the boom-chuck of the bluegrass tunes and the melancholy of the folk melodies take you to a place where the whisky tastes mild as the mountain dew and the day after Sunday is Saturday all over again.
