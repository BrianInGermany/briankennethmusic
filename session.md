## Folk Session on Jamulus

For those who don't know it, the program [Jamulus](https://jamulus.io) is _the_ solution for jamming together online remotely!

It's easy to set up, and makes realtime collaboration possible with under 40 milliseconds delay. I host my own Jamulus server, which you can think of as an online room anyone can join at anytime to play or even just listen in.

Once you've installed Jamulus, select the `Classical/Folk` server from the connection dropdown list, and search for `BriansFolkRoom`. Alternatively, just enter the IP address in the text field of the conection menu, and press connect: `20.47.112.23`

See you soon on Jamulus!
